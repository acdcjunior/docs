# Establishing a Connection

To initiate a conversation, establish a websocket connection to the following URL, including the `agentId` as a query parameter:

```text
wss://api.play.ai/v1/agent-conversation?agentId=<your_agent_id>
```

# Initial Setup Message

Upon establishing the connection, the first message sent must be a "setup" message. This message should include your API key and conform to the `AgentAPISetupMessage` type, defined as follows in TypeScript:

```typescript
type AgentAPISetupMessage = {
  type: 'setup';
  apiKey: string;
  enableVad?: boolean;
  outputFormat?: 'raw' | 'mp3' | 'wav' | 'ogg' | 'flac' | 'mulaw';
  outputSampleRate?: number;
};
```

The API key provided has to belong to the creator of the agent specified.

The default values for the setup message fields when not specified are:

- `enableVad`: false
- `outputFormat`: 'mulaw'
- `outputSampleRate`: 24000

# Sending Audio Input

After the setup, you can send audio input in the form of a `audioIn` message. The audio must be Âµ-law (mu-law) encoded at 16000Hz and sent as base64 encoded string. The message format is:

```json
{ "type": "audioIn", "data": "<base64Data>" }
```

## Sample Code for Sending Audio

```javascript
const mulawData = ...
// mulawData contains audio binary and ws is your WebSocket connection
const base64Data = btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, mulawData));
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'audioIn', data: base64Data }));
```

# Receiving Audio Output

Audio output from the server will be received in an `audioStream` message. The message format is:

```json
{ "type": "audioStream", "data": "<base64Data>" }
```

The `data` field contains base64 encoded audio binary in the selected `outputFormat`.

## Sample Code for Receiving Audio

```javascript
const base64Data = eventData.data;
const audioData = Uint8Array.from(atob(base64Data), (c) => c.charCodeAt(0));
// audioData is ready to be appended to the player buffer
player.appendAudioData(audioData);
```

# Handling New Audio Streams

A `newAudioStream` message indicates the start of a new response. It is recommended to clear your player buffer and start playing the new stream content upon receiving this message. This message contains no additional fields.

# Error Handling

Errors from the server are sent as `error` message type, a numeric code and a message in the following format:

```json
{ "type": "error", "code": <errorCode>, "message": "<errorMessage>" }
```

The table below provides a quick reference to the various error codes and their corresponding messages for the Agent Websocket API.

# Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

If VAD is enabled, you will receive `voiceActivityStart` and `voiceActivityEnd` messages indicating the detection of speech activity in the audio input. These messages help in understanding when the user starts and stops speaking.
